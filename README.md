# TSDF

TSDF Is a set of C++ classes implementing a Truncated Signed Distance Function as described in [1].
It uses GPU acceleration to deliver some kind of performance but is by no means optimised.  You might think of it as an example of how to build one rather than a performance version.

# Dependencies
As this code depends on CUDA for implementing GPU acceleration, it will require an NVidia card to run as well as CUDA libraries installed.
