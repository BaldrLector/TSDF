This is the plan A algorithm.

The approach is as follows:

1. Extract the deformed mesh from the voxel grid
	MC Pass 1: Mark all voxels which have intersection

	MC Pass 2: For each marked voxel
	Extract triangles and deform


2. For each eligible voxel in the grid
	Project the voxel centre into the rasterized depth image
	If there's both a valid depth and a valid scene flow for this pixel
		Reproject the depth image point into free space
		If the reprojected point and the original point are within a threshold distance then 
			Apply the scene flow to the voxel (weighted by distance from the reprojected point)
